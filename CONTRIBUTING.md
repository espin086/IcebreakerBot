# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We value your support and are excited to collaborate with you. Please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process.

## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

**NOTE: You are cannot commit directly to main branch, only pull requests are accepted and enforced**

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone reporurl.git
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```


4. Create a new branch for your feature:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
---

### 3. Starting a New Project

If you are starting a new project within the monorepo:
	1.	Copy the Template Project:
	- Duplicate the project-name directory into a new folder named after your project:

```bash
cp -r project_name new_project_name
```

Update the new projectâ€™s README.md, requirements.txt, and other relevant files to reflect your new project.
All your work for the new project should stay within its designated directory to maintain modularity.
Add a brief description of your project to the list of projects in the monorepo-level README.md.

### 2. Code Formatting with Black

This project enforces Python code formatting using **Black**, an opinionated code formatter. Proper code formatting is required for all contributions to maintain code consistency.

- **Pre-commit Hook**: A pre-commit hook is configured to automatically format code using Black. If your code is not properly formatted, the commit will fail.
- **GitHub Action**: We use a GitHub Action to verify code formatting. Any code that is not formatted with Black will cause the CI pipeline to fail.

#### **How to Format Code with Black**

#### **For Python Files:**

1. Install Black:
   ```bash
   pip install black
   ```

2. Format your code locally before committing:
   ```bash
   black .
   ```

#### **For Jupyter Notebooks:**

1. Install Black:
   ```bash
   pip install nbqa black
   ```

2. Format your code locally before committing:
   ```bash
   nbqa black your_notebook.ipynb
   ```

If you attempt to commit unformatted code:
   - The pre-commit hook will automatically format the code for you.
   - You will need to recommit the changes after they have been formatted.

#### **(Optional but Useful) Automatic Black Formatting in VS Code**

You can integrate Black with Visual Studio Code for automatic formatting.

1. Install the **Black Formatter Extension** in VS Code.
2. Update your VS Code settings (View > Command Palette... and run Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)):

   ```json
   "[python]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter"
   }
   ```

3. To enable format-on-save for Python files, add this to your settings:
   ```json
   "[python]": {
       "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
       "editor.formatOnSave": true
   }
   ```

### 3. Linting Python Files and Jupyter Notebooks

#### **Linting Python Files**
Before committing your code, ensure it passes all checks using Pylint for Python code quality:
1. Install Pylint:
   ```bash
   pip install pylint
   ```

2. Run Pylint locally:
   ```bash
   pylint your_python_file.py
   ```

3. To run Pylint on the entire repository:
   ```bash
   pylint .
   ```

#### **Linting Jupyter Notebooks**
Before committing your code, ensure it passes all checks using nbQA for Notebooks code quality:
1. Install :
   ```bash
   pip install nbQA
   ```

2. To lint a Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   nbQA pylint your_notebook.ipynb
   ```

3. To run nbQA on the entire repository:
   ```bash
   nbQA pylint .
   ```

### 4. Cyclomatic Complexity Testing for Python Files and Jupyter Notebooks

#### **Maintainability Index for Python Files**
Before committing your code, ensure it passes all checks using Radon for measuring maintainability index:

1. Install Radon:
   ```bash
   pip install radon
   ```

2. Run Radon locally to measure measuring maintainability:
   ```bash
   radon mi your_python_file.py
   ```

2. To run Radon on the entire repository:
   ```bash
   radon mi .
   ```

#### **Maintainability Index for Jupyter Notebooks**
Before committing your code, ensure it passes all checks using Radon for measuring maintainability index:

1. Install Radon:
   ```bash
   pip install radon
   ```

2. Run Radon locally to measure measuring maintainability:
   ```bash
   radon mi --include-ipynb your_notebook.ipynb
   ```

2. To run Radon on the entire repository:
   ```bash
   radon mi --include-ipynb .
   ```
---

### 5. Pylint, Radon, and Black Checks

Before committing your code, ensure it passes all checks by running the appropriate commands for **Black**, **Radon**, and **Pylint** as part of the repository's Makefile.

#### **Running All Checks**

1. Use the Makefile's `check` command to validate all checks:
   ```bash
   make check
   ```

2. Fix any errors indicated by Black, Radon, or Pylint before committing your code.

---

### 6. Commit Messages
1. Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
2. Follow this format:
   ```
   feat: Add a new feature
   fix: Fix an issue
   docs: Update documentation
   style: Format code (e.g., Black formatting)
   refactor: Code refactoring
   test: Add or update tests
   chore: Maintenance work
   ```

---

### 7. Submitting Your Contribution
1. Push your branch to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Create a pull request to the main repository. Note you will need to fill out a pull request form.
3. Ensure your PR passes all checks, including Black formatting, Pylint linting, and Radon maintainability checks.

---

### 8. Additional Notes
- Contributions that fail any of the checks (Black, Pylint, or Radon) will not be accepted until they are resolved.
- For questions or further assistance, feel free to open an issue or contact the maintainers.

Thank you for contributing!
